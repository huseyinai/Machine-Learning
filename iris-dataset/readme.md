# Iris Dataset Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the analysis of the Iris dataset using various algorithms, including K-means clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The Iris dataset is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations.

## Project Structure
This project is structured as follows:

- `iris_data_exploration.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration and visualization.
- `iris_kmeans.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that implements and evaluates the K-means clustering algorithm.
- `iris_knn.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of K-Nearest Neighbors to the Iris dataset.
- `iris_linear_regression.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook applying Linear Regression on the dataset.
- `iris_svm.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook employing the Support Vector Machine algorithm.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the dependencies for the project.
- `data/`: A directory containing the Iris dataset in CSV format (if applicable).

## Algorithms Used
- **K-means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used to categorize the data into clusters.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
- **Linear Regression**: A regression algorithm used to predict continuous values. Although the Iris dataset is commonly used for classification, we include Linear Regression here for demonstration purposes.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## Installation and Usage
To run the notebooks, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Open the desired notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the algorithms in action.

## Data
The Iris dataset used in this project can be loaded through the `sklearn.datasets` module, or it can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) for download.
